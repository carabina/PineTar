## Installing

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build PineTar.

To integrate PineTar into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
pod 'PineTar'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Manually
If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate PineTar into your project manually.
